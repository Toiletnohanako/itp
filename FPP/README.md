# LMSC-261-002 Intro to Programming  
## Final Project Proposal  

### **Project Title**  
**Hanako Is Hungy**

---

### **Project Summary**  
My project is an interactive pet simulation.

---

### **Resources**  
1. [Ren’Py’s Documentation](https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/index.html)  
2. [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) (used to generate art prompts for AI image creation and to check/debug Ren'Py scripts.)  
3. [Bfxr](https://www.bfxr.net)

### **Project Description**  
For my final project, I'm creating a cute, pixel-style interactive game where you raise a digital goldfish inside a virtual tank. Over three in-game days, you'll feed your goldfish and make choices that secretly affect its affection, health, and mystery—leading to different surprising endings. The game will be built in Ren'Py with branching dialogue, retro UI, and charming visuals inspired by old-school handheld pet games.

---

### **Overlap with Other Classes**  
No

---

### **Good Outcome**  
A good outcome for my final project will be a fully playable Ren'Py game with six different endings, branching story paths based on player choices.

---

### **Better Outcome**  
A better outcome would include a fully styled UI that matches the game's aesthetic.

---

### **Best Outcome**  
The best outcome would be a complete Ren'Py game with custom UI, background music, and sound effects that create a polished and immersive player experience.

---

### **Next Steps and Calendar**  
Over the next three weeks, I will first outline the story structure and plan the game’s branching paths, while reviewing Ren'Py documentation to better understand variables, choices, and UI elements.  
- **Week 1**: Story planning, branching path design, and Ren'Py documentation review  
- **Week 2**: Script writing, scene implementation, and visual asset creation  
- **Week 3**: Implement all endings, add audio, polish UI, and playtest the game  

I may need to learn basic UI customization in Ren'Py, as well as research how to manage branching logic and stat-based outcomes efficiently.
