# Hanako Is Hungy

Final project for **LMSC-261-002: Intro to Programming**  
By Hana Lin

## Project Summary

**Hanako Is Hungy** is a short interactive pet simulation game built with Ren'Py. The player feeds a goldfish named Hanako over the course of three in-game days. Each choice affects Hanako's affection, health, and mystery stats, which determine one of several unique endings.

## What I Did

- Designed the game structure, choices, branching logic, and stat system using Python in Ren'Py  
- Coded all dialogue, menus, conditional paths, and endings  
- Used `default` and `persistent` to track variables and player progress  
- Composed original background music for the game  
- Generated sound effects using **Bfxr**  
- Created Hanako’s character sprites and aquarium background using ChatGPT-generated prompts, then refined the artwork details manually  
- Designed a complete custom UI set (buttons, dialogue boxes, menus), starting from AI-generated drafts and enhancing them with my own edits  
- Organized files into folders (`audio`, `images`, `gui`, etc.) for a clean and scalable project structure  
- Used ChatGPT to help debug my code and applied its suggestions to improve logic and structure  
- Playtested the game and balanced variables to make sure all endings work properly

## Tools and Resources

- Ren'Py documentation  
- ChatGPT (used for art prompts, code checking, and debugging help)  
- Bfxr (used to generate sound effects)
- GIMP (used for cropping/editing images)
