#Haiku Documentation

## My steps

I found the Haiku in this website:
[Haiku website](https://reedsy.com/discovery/blog/haiku-poem-examples)

I typed the following code in the terminal:
`say "In pale moonlight, the wisteriaâ€™s scent, comes from far away." -o Haiku.aiff`

I copied the output file into my folder.
