## Problems & Decisions  
We worked to keep a consistent tone and layout. Decided on clear placement for GIFs and audio.

## My Contributions  
- Added a centered GIF below the "ABOUT US" title.  
- Wrote and styled my personal band member bio (Hanako).  
- Helped with layout feedback and testing.

## Self-Assessment  
I contributed visuals, writing, and layout support. I collaborated actively and helped keep things fun and consistent.

## Group Members  
- **Lilith** – Final proofreading and quality checks.  
- **Massimo** – Designed the style sheet.  
- **Anda** – Embedded and styled the MP3 audio.  
Everyone wrote their own bios and collaborated throughout.
