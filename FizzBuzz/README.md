# FizzBuzz

* I use a `for` loop to go through numbers from `1` to `100`.
* Then I use `else-if` for multiple conditions. If a number is divisible by both `3` and `5`, print `FizzBuzz`; If a number is divisible only by `3`, print `Fizz`; If a number is divisible only by `5`, print `Buzz`; Otherwise, print the number itself.
* I use `console.log()` to show the result.
* I copy the code to the Safari console, and it doesn't work.
* I check my code and find out I wrote my code incorrectly like this:  

for (let i = 1; i <= 100; 1++)；

* I change `1` to `i`:

for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++)；

* I copy the code to the Safari console and it works.
